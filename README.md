# Flipkart Clone Project

## Project Overview
This is a Flipkart clone project created to **practice full-stack development** and strengthen our coding skills.  
Currently, our focus is on **building robust backend functionality**, including API handling, state management, and data operations.  

## Design Approach
- Visual design is **not the primary focus** at the moment.  
- While we aim to **replicate Flipkart’s design accurately in the future**, for now, functionality and backend stability come first.  
- **Design improvements will be added gradually** as we progress, ensuring a polished user interface over time.  

## Project Goals
- Develop a **fully functional e-commerce clone**.  
- Practice **React, JavaScript, and backend integration**.  
- Keep improving **UI/UX** step by step while maintaining focus on core features.  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills and **write clean, maintainable code**.  

## Note
This project is primarily a **learning and experimental project**.  
The aim is to **build a strong foundation first**, and enhance the design gradually.  

> "Functionality first, design later—but never compromise on learning and code quality."
